# DOS C Compiler Benchmark (dccb)
Provides a small but non-trivial real-world codebase for recreational performance-testing of older C compilers.

The code is that of a simple VGA mode 13h software 3d rasterizer, which operates mostly but not exclusively on integers. DOS is its target environment.

# Building
Batch files are provided under the `build` directory for building dccb with various C/C++ compilers:
- Microsoft C 5
- Microsoft C/C++ 8
- Borland Turbo C 2
- Borland C++ 2
- HI-TECH Pacific C 7
- Digital Mars C/C++ 8
- Open Watcom C/C++
